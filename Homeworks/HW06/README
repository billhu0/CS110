Hi! We are glad to see you trying to typeset this homework.

The main.tex is where we frame this homework, but all
contents are included in other `.tex` files.

- To do section 1, refer to `cache_basic.tex`.
- For section 2, go to `overbyte.tex`.
- For section 3, go to `practical.tex`.
- You are recommended to complete a small survey in
`feedback.tex`. Points will not be counted in this section
but it's great to hear from you! :)
