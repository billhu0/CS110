# Project 2.1: ALU and Regfile

For more details please refer to the [course page](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/courses/ca/22s/projects/2.1/).

In this project, you will create an ALU that supports all the operations needed by the instructions in our ISA, and a RegFile which should be able to write to or read from these registers specified in a given RISC-V instruction. 

# Project 2.2: CPU

For more details please refer to the [course page](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/courses/ca/22s/projects/2.2/).

In this project you will be using logisim-evolution to implement a 32-bit 2-stage pipelined processor based on RISC-V. The processor must follow the architecture of RISC-V datapath, including 5 stages named Instruction Fetch, Instruction Decode, Execution, Memory and Write Back. Additionally, some key modules like ImmGen, Branch_Comp and Control Logic (the most important module) have to be implemented by yourself with only basic built-in components in Logisim. The ALU and RegFile youâ€™ve implemented in Project 2.1 can be directly utilized in this project.

The processor should be able to parse and execute the given list of RISC-V instructions one after another, and correctly handle the 2-stage pipelined scenario in case a conditional or unconditional jump is taken.

Once you've completed this project, you'll know essentially everything you need to build a computer from scratch with nothing but transistors.
